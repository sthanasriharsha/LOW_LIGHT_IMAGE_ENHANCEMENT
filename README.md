# LOW_LIGHT_IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT
We propose a new method to enhance nighttime roadside images for intelligent transportation. Unlike traditional techniques that cause color issues, our approach uses inverse tone mapping, motion-based highlighting, and pyramid fusion to improve clarity and realism. Tests show it outperforms existing methods in detail and color accuracy.
